# simple-linear-regression
Here, we created a very simple Machine Learning Model using Simple Linear Regression. We used scikit-learn Machine Learning Library of Python to make this model working. This is the reference code and dataset to my blog:- https://alphateds.com/coding-simple-linear-regression/

## how Simple Linear Regression Works?

The goal of simple linear regression is to find the relationship between a independent variable x and target variable y. We want to make a model which predicts the value of y from x.
